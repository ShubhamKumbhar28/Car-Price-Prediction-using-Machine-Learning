### CAR PRICE PREICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

The Car Price Prediction project is a machine learning model designed to predict the selling price of cars. This model takes into account various features such as the car's brand and model, its age, original price, mileage, fuel type, selling type (e.g., dealer or individual), transmission type, and the number of previous owners. This project aims to provide valuable insights for both sellers and buyers in the used car market, helping them to make informed decisions.

### Dataset 

The dataset for this project comprises several attributes for each car listing:

- Car_Name: The name of the car

- Year: The year of manufacture

- Selling_Price: The price the owner wants to sell the car at (this is the target variable)

- Present_Price: The current ex-showroom price of the car

- Driven_kms: Number of kilometers the car has been driven

- Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car (Petrol/Diesel/Electric/CNG)

- Selling_type: The type of seller (Dealer/Individual)
